This is a research work I completed in an undergraduate research project with Prof. Xiangliang Zhang in the Department of Computer Scince and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. The MWP database was constructed with the help of Zhenwen Liang from Prof. Zhang's group and is partially supported by the Internal Asia Researh Collaboration Grant, University of Notre Dame. The original dataset is called NoahQA.
