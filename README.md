# Math_WP_Tutor

This is a research work I completed in an undergraduate research project with Prof. Xiangliang Zhang in the Department of Computer Scince and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. The MWP database was constructed with the help of Zhenwen Liang from Prof. Zhang's group and is partially supported by the Internal Asia Researh Collaboration Grant, University of Notre Dame. The original dataset is called NoahQA.

The webapp was created using the standard React.js framework (see https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). A development react server can be run in the terminal with the command 'npm start'. A Node.js server should be run in parallel on a seperate terminal which can be started with the command 'node server'. Both commands should be run in the mathWP_tutor directory for success.
